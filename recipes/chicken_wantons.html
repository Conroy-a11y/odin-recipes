    <h1>Chicken Wontons with Spicy Sauce</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my new chicken wonton method – steaming them up with with a spicy
      sauce that is somewhere between dipping sauce and soup broth. It’s meant
      to be eaten in a bowl, like a soup – kinda, but it’s so much more than
      just broth with wontons. It’s luscious, dippable, scoopable, slurpable,
      and full of umami from the shiitake mushrooms and greens (like spinach or
      bok choy), if you choose to add some. The sesame oil gives even more
      depth, and the chili oil gives a bit of heat and a pop of color.
