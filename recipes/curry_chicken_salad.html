    <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <li>
        Cook the chicken: Cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally so they
        are very thin. Sprinkle chicken with curry powder, garlic powder, and
        onion powder. Season with salt and pepper. Saut√© in a nonstick skillet
        over medium high heat with a drizzle of olive oil until golden brown and
        cooked through. When cooled, chop the chicken into small pieces and
        chill in the fridge.

        Assemble your Curry Chicken Salad: Once the chicken is cool enough, mix
        in a medium bowl with all remaining ingredients. Season to taste with
        more curry powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and (obvi) salt and
        pepper. Serve over greens, on a croissant, on toast, in a wrap, or my
        personal favorite: on an everything bagel.
